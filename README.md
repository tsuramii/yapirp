# YAPIRP - Yet Another API Requests Practice

A simple project for practicing API requests using GitHub API. This project allows you to enter a GitHub username, fetch the user's data from the GitHub API, and display it in a user card format. It is built using HTML, JavaScript, and utilizes the Picocss library for minimal styling.
